## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid

### Continued development

One of the key areas I want to continue focusing on in future projects is media queries. While I've made significant progress in creating responsive designs, I aim to further refine and perfect my understanding and implementation of media queries.

### Useful resource

- [A (more) Modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-more-modern-css-reset/) - This helped me reset the default styling for better consistency across browsers. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
